Simulation in computer graphics. This code should be reasonably close to the C++ skeleton provided by the lecturer. If in doubt please check the C++ skeleton.

## Comments C++ conversion
* In C++ Vector is more integrated. In Python make sure to use np.array explicitly.
* C++ double precision is 53 bits usually. Python float has 53 bits precision as well,
  so doubles can be replaced by the Python build in float.
